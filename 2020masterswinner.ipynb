    "This analysis focuses on predicting the 2020 Masters winner using multivariate linear regression.  The Masters is one of golf's four major championships.  Unlike American football, basketball or tennis, golf is played individually and not based on matches.  The field is make up of 96 players invited based on a set of qualifying criteria. The lowest score after four rounds of golf (72 holes) wins.  \n",

    "## Data set\n",
    "I chose PGA Tour ShotLink data from 1980 to 2019 (www.shotlink.com and www.pgatour.com).  This is the largest set of data available on these metrics.  The data is manually collected by volunteers who follow every PGA Tour player and record every shot made in every PGA Tour tournament.  I was looking into scraping the data when I realized someone on Kaggle had already done this (https://www.kaggle.com/bradklassen/pga-tour-20102018-data).  I instead used this data set, formatted it, and cleaned out obvious errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Limitations:</b>\n",
    "- <b>Having enough data:</b> Unfortunately, the data was only available until year end 2019.  I would have liked to have analyzed the data around player's 2020 tournament performances leading up to the Masters tournament, and create a \"trending score\".  Here is the explanation of why the data was delted (https://www.kaggle.com/data/174010).\n",
    "- <b>Having the right variables:</b> While there are hundreds of variables tracked by the PGA tour, I would ideally like more data on how they play the golf course that hosts the Masters tournament (Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia) and potentially how they play similar holes at other courses leading up to the Masters tournament.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "After analyzing the lowest scorers at prior Masters tournaments and top finishers over the last 3 years, I found that P-values were high and the R-squared values were low for most variables.  There also wasn't much consistency in the results of independent variables between these two subsets of data.  This is not ideal for linear regression.  Other non-linear models (machine learning, the Elo rating system) may be better matches to predict the outcome of the 2020 Masters winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "After trying multiple different iterations of potential models, I focused on a multivariate linear regression model that utilized the top 3 independent variables that had the lowest P-values and highest R-squared values (GIR, Scrambling and Putts).  I also used a subset of the data set that was an aggregate of the last two years of player's results at the Masters Tournament (2018 and 2019 Masters).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Multivariate linear regression model:</b>  Score = 59.0038 - (0.2305 x GIR) - (0.0149 x Scrambling) + (17.4504 x Putts)\n",

(The GIR stroke is determined by subtracting 2 from par (1st stroke on a par 3, 2nd on a par 4, 3rd on a par 5))\n",
    "    #Driving Accuracy Percentage: The percentage of time a tee shot comes to rest in the fairway (regardless of club)\n",
    "    #Scrambling: The percent of time a player misses the green in regulation, but still makes par or better.\n",
    "    #Scoring Average (Actual): The average number of strokes per completed round.\n",
    "    #Official Money: The total official money a player has earned year-to-date. Note: This is for PGA TOUR members only.\n",
    "    #Percentage of Available Purse Won: For official events, the player's total money won as a percentage of the total purse available.\n",
    "    #Driving Distance: The average number of yards per measured drive. These drives are measured on two holes per round. Care is taken to select two holes which face in opposite directions to counteract the effect of wind. Drives are measured to the point at which they come to rest regardless of whether they are in the fairway or not.\n",
    "    #Sand Save Percentage: The percent of time a player was able to get 'up and down' once in a greenside sand bunker (regardless of score). Note: 'Up and down' indicates it took the player 2 shots or less to put the ball in the hole from that point.\n",
    "    #Overall Putting Average: The average number of putts for all holes played (total putts / total holes played)."

    "- The average number of putts were 1.681 or lower\n",
    "- With the exception of Mickelson in 2010 and Schwartzel in 2011, sand saves were above 50%.  Sand saves are difficult to use as restriction to an analysis, because they are only relevant if the player misses the green (opposite of a GIR) and the ball lands in the sand.  In addition, it is difficult to apply a player's prior Sandies record to their future 2020 Master's performance outside of prior Masters tournaments because the sand used in the bunkers are not what is typically used at other golf courses (it is made of material from feldspar mines in North Carolina).\n",
